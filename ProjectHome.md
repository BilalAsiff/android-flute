# Android Flute #

Launching this project for the following reasons:
  * For fun.
  * Learning how to create MIDI File. There has no javax.sound library in android since 1.0.  ( **I really hope android would support MIDI Synthesizer in the future** ).
  * Current Flute Apps on Android are.........

In the beginning, the project is totally inspired by http://www.jfugue.org/ and I learned a lot of MIDI knowledge from jfugue. I really appreciate jfugue's effort although it is impossible to use it on Android.

PS. I recently found iPhone has a very good flute program. I'm too late.
